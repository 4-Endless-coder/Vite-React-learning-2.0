## 🚀 About This Repository

This project serves as a live, interactive documentation of my journey through React. Instead of abstract notes, each concept is implemented as a working component within this Vite application. The main `README.md` (which you are reading) acts as the "pinned" table of contents for all the concepts covered.

**Its purpose is twofold:**
1.  **As a Learning Tool:** To solidify my understanding by building.
2.  **As a Quick Reference:** To provide a "cookbook" of ready-to-use code snippets for common React patterns and hooks.
